      Not a few of our readers will remember the ascent of Nadar’s colossal
      balloon from Paris, on Sunday, the 18th of October, 1863. This balloon was
      remarkable as having attached to it a regular two-story house for a car.
      Its ascent was witnessed by nearly half a million of persons. The balloon,
      after passing over the eastern part of France, Belgium, and Holland,
      suffered a disastrous descent in Hanover the day after it started on its
      perilous journey. It was a fool-hardy enterprise to construct such a
      gigantic and unmanageable balloon, presenting such an immense surface to
      the atmosphere, and being so susceptible to adverse aerial currents as to
      become the helpless prey of the elements; and it was still more fool-hardy
      to place the lives of its passengers at the mercy of such terrible and
      ungovernable forces. A large section of the public laboured under the
      delusion that Nadar’s balloon was one capable of being steered. In
      reality, however, the ‘Geant’ was unquestionably the most rebellious and
      unruly specimen of its class that has been made since the days of
      Montgolfier. The object in view when this formidable monster was designed
      and constructed was to create the means to collect sufficient funds to
      form a “Free Association for Aerial Navigation by means of MACHINES
      HEAVIER THAN AIR,” and for the construction of machines on this principle.
      The receipts from the exhibition of the “Geant” were intended to form the
      first capital of the association. The hopes, however, of the promoters
      have not been realised in this respect; for while the expenses of the
      construction of the balloon have amounted, directly and indirectly, to the
      sum of L8,300, its two ascents in Paris and its exhibition in London
      produced only L3,300.
